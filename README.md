- As a bus commuter, I want to see when the next bus is coming by my house to decide whether I should take the bus or the train
- As a train commuter, I want to see service advisories for the trains that I most commonly take on a single page to avoid making multiple search requests.
- As a weekend traveler, I want to see what the weekend delays will be for trains I occasionally take to avoid unforeseen delays
- As a mobile phone user, I want this info to be laid out in a responsive format, so I don't have to squint to see the information
